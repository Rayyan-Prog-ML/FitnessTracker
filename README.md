Console Application written in C#

Project Overview:
Fitness Tracker Pro is a user-friendly console application designed to empower individuals on their fitness journeys. It goes beyond basic workout tracking by offering features like selecting exercises from the given list or even adding custom exercises, a badge system for motivation, personalized recommendations, and LeaderBoards.




Functionality and Development
What it Does:
Fitness Tracker Pro offers the following functionalities:
●	Recommendation System:
○	You will get the recommendation for warm-up exercise at the start and will get a cool-down recommendation at the end of the workout.



●	Workout Tracking:
○	Log completed exercises, sets, and reps.

○	Calculate the total reps for each workout.

●	Exercise Library:
○	Access pre-defined exercises with descriptions and variations 

○	Add custom exercises with descriptions and variations.

●	Badge System:

○	Earn Bronze, Silver, or Gold badges based on total reps completed per workout.
○	Provides a sense of accomplishment and motivates users to push further.
●	Recommendation System:

○	Recommendations with intuitive prompts and instructions with every difficulty.

●	Leaderboards:

○	Compete with your friends and motivate yourself to be the next by pushing yourself to a higher league.

            




Tools and Techniques:

●	Programming Language: C++


●	Modules:

○	Introduction Module: Welcomes users and highlights program benefits. 

○	Exercise Module: Manages exercise details (pre-defined and custom).

○	Workout Module: Tracks user workouts (sets, reps, total reps).

○	Summary Module: Displays workout summary and awards badges. 

○	Saving_Leaderboard: Saves the leaderboard in a text file(file handling).


●	ASCII Art:

○	Simple representations of exercise variations enhance user understanding.

●	External header files:

    Use of stdlib.h to give the system the argument to clear the console 
    
               Use of Windows.h to use the sleep function                  
	   


Future Enhancements:

●	Data Structures:

○	Will use algorithm for linear search, sorting , data manipulation for better performance.

●	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

○	(Future Enhancement) Implementing classes for exercises, users, and badges can enhance code organization and scalability.

●	Personalized Recommendations:

○	Analyze user data to suggest exercises based on fitness level and goals. 

●	Data Analysis:

○	Generate charts and reports to track progress and identify areas for improvement.
